# bt-pair-lwdb

This small utility program allows a Bluetooth device to be paired to the current Linux operating system without breaking the pairing between the same device and a Windows operating system installed on the same machine. For the program to work, several conditions must be met: 

  (1) the device must be paired with the Windows operating system
  (2) the device must have been paired with the Linux operating system at least once prior.
  (3) `chntpw` must be installed
